# Open Bioinformatics Course #2

## This IPython notebook is a part of an online course on Bioinformatics:

### **Finding the site of the Ori (Origin Of Replication of DNA).**
> This is the part of a string of DNA where the strands are separated and replication begins.

### **Finding the Hamming distance.**
> When comparing two strings of DNA, we count the number of mismatches.
> This is known as the Hamming distance.

### **Find all kmers of Hamming distance d away within a string of DNA.**
> Starting with a string of DNA, we look through the string of DNA and find segments
> of equal length that are of Hamming distance at most d away. (d mismatches between strings)

### **Enumerating all possible DNA strings of length k and then comparing whether the gene matches with these strings within a Hamming distance of 1.**
